# My script for scalable featurization demonstration.

I am demonstrating how to perform this featurization if you have a lot of images.
doAzureParallel is a friend if you have this problem. You will see it's easy to run
the very same code you saw on a cluster, if your computation is data-paralle.

I uploaded a large dataset in the cloud - blob storage.

* setup and provision cluster
* start with small cluster and small dataset, walk through the serial exec as well as cluster exec
* show it runs a bit slower on a small cluster, so you have overhead
* show how you collect the data and save it as featurized Rds
* switch to larger cluster, change batch size parameter
* show how the cluster goes to "running" and starts provisioning new VMs to scale out
  Use the time to demonstrate the Azure portal.
* Shut down the clusters (delete the pools)
